% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Introduction}
Logistic regression has been proved to be too simple to solve some of the classification problems. In this paper, we manage to implement a more advanced machine learning system with the introduce of hidden layers,regularization and different kinds of activation functions.Our models are evaluated on the MNIST dataset to do fashion classification test. As a result, our model  achieves an average accuracy of $ 99\% $. We hope our efforts can clearly explain the importance of hidden layers,regularization and different kinds of activation functions.
